# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Run `npm install` and `npm test` locally.
3. Follow code style: `npm run lint` and fix issues.
4. Create a PR with a clear description and link to any related issues.

Be sure not to commit secrets; use `.env` for local variables and add them to `.gitignore`.
