# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please open an issue or contact the maintainers.

Responsible disclosure: give maintainers up to 90 days to respond.

Suggested quick checks before reporting:
- Are secrets (API keys, tokens) accidentally committed?
- Are dependencies outdated? Run `npm audit`.
